# Ghost

An experimental LESS-based grid system using parametric mixins to encourage semantic HTML.

Ghost uses CSS3's <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/03/CSS-layout-gets-smarter-with-calc">calc() property</a> to provide fixed-width gutters with fluid-width columns without resorting to padding hacks. Older browsers will use fluid gutters. Ghost was built during Fluent 2013 and was inspired by @danmurphy's [simple grid](https://github.cfpb.gov/pages/danmurphy/DansDoodles/html5-framework/grid-system/grid_percent.html) and a comment @scranfill made in #dev-tango.

## Semantic HTML

Instead of:

```
<header class="row">
    <aside class="span4">
        Lorem ipsum Ut deserunt do nostrud. 
    </aside>
    <section class="span8">
        Lorem ipsum Voluptate pariatur Duis fugiat cupidatat quis pariatur.
    </section>
</header>
```

Ghost allows you to write:

```
<header>
    <aside class="welcome-message">
        Lorem ipsum Ut deserunt do nostrud. 
    </aside>
    <section class="customer-info">
        Lorem ipsum Voluptate pariatur Duis fugiat cupidatat quis pariatur.
    </section>
</header>
```

Using LESS that looks like this:

```
header {
  .row();
}

.welcome-message {
  .span(4);
}

.customer-info {
  .span(8);
}
```

## Getting Started

Grab `ghost.less` from the `dist` directory and @import it at the top of your application's LESS stylesheet. Some in-progress examples of how to use Ghost can be found in `dist/examples.zip`.

## Documentation
_(Coming soon)_

## Examples

Examples can be found in the archive at `dist/example.zip`. Note: They use less.js to compile their LESS. You'll need to run a server locally to avoid cross-origin complaints. Try `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the example's directory.

## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
