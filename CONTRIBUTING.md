Edit the files in `src` and run `grunt build` whenever you're ready to compile LESS and automagically copy 
appropriate source files into the `dist` dir, archiving the examples in a .zip. Running `grunt` with no options 
will start a server on port 8000 (for testing the 
[examples](https://github.cfpb.gov/front/ghost/tree/master/src/examples) locally) and automatically `build` 
whenever a source file is changed.

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
